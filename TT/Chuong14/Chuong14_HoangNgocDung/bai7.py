# Use the Standard_deck class of this section to create a simplified version of the game War.
# In this game, there are two players. Each starts with half of a deck. The players each deal
# the top card from their decks and whoever has the higher card wins the other playerâ€™s cards
# and adds them to the bottom of his deck. If there is a tie, the two cards are eliminated from
# play (this differs from the actual game, but is simpler to program). The game ends when one
# player runs out of cards
