"""Crossword cheater: When working on a crossword puzzle, often you will have a word where
you know several of the letters, but not all of them. You can write a computer program to
help you. For the program, the user should be able to input a word with the letters they
know filled in and asterisks for those they donâ€™t know. The program should print out a list
of all words that fit that description. For example, the input th***ly should return all the
words that could work, namely thickly and thirdly."""
