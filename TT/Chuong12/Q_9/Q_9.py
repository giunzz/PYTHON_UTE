"""
Benfordâ€™s law states that in real data where the values are spread across several orders of
magnitude, about 30% of the values will start with the number 1, whereas only about 4.6%
of the values will start with the number 9. This is contrary to what we might expect, namely
that values starting with 1 and 9 would be equally likely. Using the file expenses.txt which
consists of a number of costs from an expense account, determine what percentage start with
each of the digits 1 through 9. This technique is used by accountants to detect fraud.
